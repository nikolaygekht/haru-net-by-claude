# Resources

* All the resources (images, fonts) are kept in Resource folder of the project

  * Content of this folder is automaticaly copied to output folder of the application (but without Resource in the name!), so,
    if the path of the resource is `Resource/demo/ttfont/noto.ttf` then path to be used is `demo/ttfont/noto.ttf`

  * The demo application sets current folder to the folder where exe file is located.

  * The demo application creates folders pdfs in the folder where exe file is located to output pdfs. All pdfs must be saved there.
