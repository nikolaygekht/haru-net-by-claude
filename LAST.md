# Level 5 Complete: PDF Stream Objects ✓

All PDF stream objects have been successfully implemented and tested with real PDF data!

## Previous Progress

**Levels 1-4 Completed:**
- ✓ Level 1: Basic types (Point, Rect, Color, Matrix, Date, Enums, Constants)
- ✓ Level 2: Error handling (HpdfException)
- ✓ Level 3: Stream abstraction (HpdfStream, HpdfMemoryStream)
- ✓ Level 4: PDF Primitive Objects (Null, Boolean, Number, Real, Name, String, Binary, Array, Dict)

## Level 5: Stream Objects Implementation

### HpdfStreamObject (New ✓)
A PDF stream object is a **dictionary with associated binary data**. In PDF format:
```
<< dictionary entries >>
stream
...binary data...
endstream
```

**Key Features:**
- Inherits from `HpdfDict` (so it has all dictionary functionality)
- Contains an internal `HpdfMemoryStream` for binary data
- Supports stream filters (compression)
- Automatically updates `/Length` entry when writing
- Writes in proper PDF format with `stream...endstream` markers

### Stream Filters Implemented

**HpdfStreamFilter Enum (Updated):**
- `None` - No compression
- `FlateDecode` - **zlib compression** (fully implemented ✓)
- `AsciiHexDecode` - ASCII hex encoding (defined, not yet used)
- `Ascii85Decode` - ASCII base-85 encoding (defined, not yet used)
- `DctDecode` - JPEG compression (defined, not yet used)
- `CcittFaxDecode` - CCITT fax compression (defined, not yet used)

### Flate Compression Implementation

**Critical Discovery:** PDF's `FlateDecode` uses **zlib format**, not raw deflate!

**Zlib Format Structure:**
```
[2-byte header] [deflate-compressed data] [4-byte Adler32 checksum]
```

**Our Implementation:**
- Writes zlib header bytes: `0x78 0x9C` (CMF and FLG)
- Compresses data using .NET's `DeflateStream`
- Appends Adler32 checksum (computed manually)
- Fully compatible with real PDF streams ✓

### Real PDF Stream Validation

Tested against **actual PDF stream data** (embedded as test resources):

1. **stream1.txt** - Uncompressed PDF graphics stream (2459 bytes)
   - Contains PDF operators: `BT`, `ET`, `Tf`, `Td`, `Tj`, `re`, `S`, etc.
   - Successfully read and regenerated ✓
   - Embedded in `Haru.Test/Resources/stream1.txt` ✓

2. **stream2.txt** - Compressed PDF stream (575 bytes compressed)
   - Successfully decompressed using our zlib implementation ✓
   - Round-trip compression/decompression works perfectly ✓
   - Embedded in `Haru.Test/Resources/stream2.txt` ✓

### Test Coverage

**All 229 tests passing** ✓

**Stream Object Tests (19 tests):**

**Unit Tests (HpdfStreamObjectTests.cs - 12 tests):**
- Empty stream handling
- Uncompressed stream writing
- Filter entry management
- Flate compression functionality
- Compression validation (round-trip decompress)
- Length field updates
- Stream clearing
- Dictionary entry support
- Multiple filter support
- Offset writing
- Inheritance from HpdfDict

**Integration Tests (HpdfStreamObjectIntegrationTests.cs - 7 tests):**
- Real uncompressed PDF graphics stream (using embedded stream1.txt)
- Real compressed PDF stream decompression (using embedded stream2.txt)
- Graphics operator preservation
- Compression round-trip with real data
- Large content compression efficiency
- Stream object with metadata (Type, Subtype, BBox)
- All tests use embedded resources loaded via `LoadEmbeddedResource()` helper

## Design Decisions

1. **Zlib Format**: Implemented full zlib format (not raw deflate) to match PDF spec
2. **Adler32 Checksum**: Manually computed for zlib compatibility
3. **Dictionary Inheritance**: Stream objects are dictionaries, so inherit from HpdfDict
4. **Lazy Stream Creation**: Stream is only created when first accessed
5. **Length Auto-Update**: Length is calculated and updated during WriteValue()
6. **Filter Array**: Filters are stored as an array in the `/Filter` entry
7. **Embedded Test Resources**: Real PDF streams embedded in test assembly for portability

## What's Next?

With stream objects complete, the next levels to implement are:

### Level 6: Cross-Reference System
- HpdfXref - Cross-reference table
- HpdfXrefEntry - Individual xref entries
- Object ID management
- Indirect object references

### Level 7: Document Structure
- HpdfCatalog - Document catalog
- HpdfPages - Page tree
- HpdfPage - Individual pages
- Integration with stream objects for page content

### Level 8: Resources
- Font dictionaries
- Image XObjects (using stream objects)
- Color spaces
- Graphics states

Would you like to proceed with implementing the cross-reference system (Level 6)?
