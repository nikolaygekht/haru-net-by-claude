# PDF Encryption Implementation - Session Summary

## Date
2025-10-09

## Objective
Complete the implementation and testing of PDF encryption functionality for the Haru PDF Library C# port, supporting RC4 (40-bit and 128-bit) and AES-128 encryption modes.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Fixed All Encryption Issues
Successfully debugged and resolved all encryption-related problems that prevented PDFs from opening correctly:

#### a) Document ID Requirement
- **Problem**: All PDFs returning "password is incorrect"
- **Root Cause**: Missing Document ID in trailer (required for encryption)
- **Solution**: Added Document ID generation with check for existing IDs (from PDF/A)
- **File Modified**: `HpdfDocument.cs:ApplyEncryption()`

#### b) RC4 40-bit (R2) Password Encoding
- **Problem**: test_rc4_40bit failing password validation
- **Root Cause**: Passwords encoded in UTF-8 instead of Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1)
- **Solution**: Changed password encoding to ISO-8859-1 per PDF specification
- **File Modified**: `HpdfEncrypt.cs:PadOrTruncatePassword()`

#### c) AES-128 (R4) Algorithm Issues
- **Problem**: test_aes_128 failing password validation
- **Root Causes**:
  - Mode checks were `== R3` instead of `>= R3`, so R4 didn't get 50 MD5 iterations
  - Missing "sAlT" suffix in object-specific key derivation for AES
  - EncryptionKey buffer too small (needed 25 bytes, had 21)
- **Solutions**:
  - Changed all mode checks to `Mode >= HpdfEncryptMode.R3`
  - Added "sAlT" bytes (0x73, 0x41, 0x6C, 0x54) to InitKey for R4
  - Increased EncryptionKey buffer to `Md5KeyLength + 9`
- **File Modified**: `HpdfEncrypt.cs:CreateOwnerKey(), CreateEncryptionKey(), InitKey()`

#### d) AES Empty Page Issue
- **Problem**: AES PDF opened but showed empty page
- **Root Cause**: AES cipher created once but never reinitialized with object-specific keys
- **Solution**: Always call `_aes.Init(Md5EncryptionKey)` before each encryption operation
- **File Modified**: `HpdfEncrypt.cs:Encrypt(), CryptBuffer()`

#### e) Stream Length Zero Issue
- **Problem**: Encrypted PDFs showing `/Length 0` in stream objects
- **Root Cause**: Length entry updated AFTER dictionary was written to stream
- **Solution**: Refactored WriteValue to prepare stream data FIRST, then update Length, then write dictionary
- **File Modified**: `HpdfStreamObject.cs:WriteValue(), PrepareStreamData()`

### 2. Implemented Content Encryption Pipeline

#### Encryption Context Mechanism
- Added `EncryptionContext` property to `HpdfStream` class
- Modified `HpdfXref.WriteObjects()` to initialize encryption keys per object
- Ensured Encrypt dictionary itself is NOT encrypted

#### Object Encryption
Modified these objects to check for encryption context and encrypt their content:
- **HpdfString**: Encrypts string data before writing
- **HpdfBinary**: Encrypts binary data before writing
- **HpdfStreamObject**: Encrypts stream data AFTER compression (per PDF spec)

#### Files Modified
- `HpdfStream.cs`: Added EncryptionContext property
- `HpdfString.cs`: Added encryption in WriteValue()
- `HpdfBinary.cs`: Added encryption in WriteValue()
- `HpdfStreamObject.cs`: Refactored PrepareStreamData() with encryption
- `HpdfXref.cs`: Added per-object encryption key initialization

### 3. Created Comprehensive Test Suite

#### Unit Tests: HpdfEncryptTests.cs (16 tests)
- Constructor and initialization
- Encryption mode settings (R2, R3, R4)
- Password padding (user and owner)
- Owner key creation algorithms
- Encryption key generation
- User key creation algorithms
- Object-specific key initialization
- Different keys for different objects
- R4 AES salt appending
- RC4 and AES encryption operations
- Various password lengths
- Permission flags

#### Integration Tests: HpdfEncryptionIntegrationTests.cs (24 tests)
- All three encryption modes (R2, R3, R4)
- PDF dictionary structure verification
- Document ID handling
- PDF/A ID reuse
- PDF version auto-updates (1.4 for R3, 1.6 for R4)
- Content encryption (strings, streams, page content)
- Various permission combinations
- Edge cases (empty passwords, long passwords, special characters)
- Multi-page document encryption
- File save operations
- IsEncrypted property verification

**Test Results**: All 40 tests passed successfully ✓

## Technical Implementation Details

### PDF Encryption Architecture
- **Object-by-Object Encryption**: Each PDF object encrypted with unique key
- **Key Derivation**: Document key + object ID + generation number (+ "sAlT" for AES)
- **Encryption Order**: Compress → Encrypt → Write
- **Length Calculation**: Must account for encryption overhead before writing dictionary

### Encryption Algorithms Implemented
- **Algorithm 3.1/3.1a**: Object-specific key derivation
- **Algorithm 3.2**: Encryption key generation
- **Algorithm 3.3**: Owner key creation
- **Algorithm 3.4**: User key creation (R2)
- **Algorithm 3.5**: User key creation (R3+)

### Supported Encryption Modes
1. **R2**: 40-bit RC4, PDF 1.2+
2. **R3**: 128-bit RC4, PDF 1.4+
3. **R4**: 128-bit AES, PDF 1.6+

### Password Encoding
- PDF specification requires Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1) encoding
- Passwords padded to 32 bytes with standard PDF padding string
- Passwords truncated at 32 bytes if longer

## Verification

All four test PDFs now open correctly with password validation:
- ✓ test_rc4_40bit.pdf (R2 encryption)
- ✓ test_rc4_128bit.pdf (R3 encryption)
- ✓ test_aes_128.pdf (R4 encryption)
- ✓ test_permissions.pdf (Permission flags)

All 40 encryption tests pass successfully.

## Status
**COMPLETE** ✓

The PDF encryption implementation is now fully functional, tested, and verified to comply with PDF specification standards for revisions 2, 3, and 4 (RC4 40-bit, RC4 128-bit, and AES-128).

## Next Steps
None. The encryption implementation is complete and ready for use.
